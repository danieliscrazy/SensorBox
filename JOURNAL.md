4:00 PM: So I've been thinking about what project I could make as my last project, but the issue is, I essentially have 2 days to make it (as well as finish my previous project once its PCB arrives). I additionally can't really go to Micro Center again soon, because my family's car broke down (insert Slack :heavysob: emoji here). So I was gonna make a list of the parts that I have and ask other people what I should make, but as I was making it, I remembered this giant kit of 48 different sensors that I got a while back. Most of them were fairly useless (cough cough traffic light led cough cough "magical light cup" cough cough). However, I noticed a specific module, the MQ3, and thought, "I could make a breathalyzer!" (it's an alcohol sensor) But then I realized that a breathalyzer would make no sense, so I looked to its cousin, the more useful MQ2. The MQ2 detects gas and smoke. I could make a smoke alarm! This'd be great for me, as I recently realized that sleeping with my door closed and with no smoke alarm in my room is not a good idea. But a smoke alarm would be too simple, even with a cool case I wouldn't call that a 6 point project. So I looked to my other sensors. I've also got a DHT11 temperature and humidity detector, so I could make it detect that too. But it still felt too basic. So I'm gonna also add a 16x2 LCD, a button, a piezo buzzer, and potentially more. I'm gonna try to use CircuitPython for this, but I'm not very experienced in CircuitPython, so it may be a bit more difficult for me.
